# Portal-Executable-Images-Malware-Analysis-using-Deep-Convolutional-Networks

Portable Executables: The Portable Executable (PE) format is a ﬁle format for executables, object code, DLLs, and others used in 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows operating systems.

<h2>Problem Introduction </h2>

1. Visualizing PE as images
2. Using Deep Learning to classify PE’s containing Malwares


<h2>Dataset</h2>

Virus MNIST: Portable Executable Files as Images that consists of 10 executable code varieties and
approximately 50,000 virus examples for Malware Detection. The malicious classes include 9 families of
computer viruses and one benign set. Dataset is available on Kaggle.

<h2>Data Preprocessing </h2>
1. Malook for converting the PE ﬁles to images using Nearest interpolation
2. Rescaling/Standardization: 32 X 32 gray scale images
3. Dimensionality reduction (PCA T-SNE, and Truncated SVD) Tomek, Nearest Neighbour and cluster centroids for cleaning the data points
4. Features signiﬁcance using feature importance graphs and density plot visualizations

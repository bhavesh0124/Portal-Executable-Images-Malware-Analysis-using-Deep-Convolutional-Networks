# Portal-Executable-Images-Malware-Analysis-using-Deep-Convolutional-Networks

Portable Executables: The Portable Executable (PE) format is a ﬁle format for executables, object code, DLLs, and others used in 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows operating systems.

<h2>Problem Introduction </h2>

1. Visualizing PE as images
2. Using Deep Learning to classify PE’s containing Malwares


<h2>Dataset</h2>

Virus MNIST: Portable Executable Files as Images that consists of 10 executable code varieties and
approximately 50,000 virus examples for Malware Detection. The malicious classes include 9 families of
computer viruses and one benign set. Dataset is available on Kaggle.

<h2>Data Preprocessing </h2>

1. Malook for converting the PE ﬁles to images using Nearest interpolation
2. Rescaling/Standardization: 32 X 32 gray scale images
3. Dimensionality reduction (PCA T-SNE, and Truncated SVD) Tomek, Nearest Neighbour and cluster centroids for cleaning the data points
4. Features signiﬁcance using feature importance graphs and density plot visualizations


<h2>Model building</h2>

We implemented couple of traditional machine learning models (such as XgBoost, LightGBM) and deep learning models (such as DNN, CNN, ResNet, MobileNet,LSTM, SqueezeNet), then compared the performance of each model using the frameworks below


<h2>Evaluation and Metric</h2>
For evaluating all our models we have used the holdout strategy of creating a dataset using the sklearn test and train split. We have passed the stratify parameter that preserves the same proportions of examples in each class as observed. We calculated both the accuracy and ‘weighted’ F1 score
